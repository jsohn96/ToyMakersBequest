// for yiwen 
for the rotating path puzzle 

basic functions 

PathNode.cs
- rotate the cylinder 
- rotate the cylinder to the right position -- more robust condition test 
- //[DONE] linear path (continued) 
- //linear path (segemented : need to rotate twice)
- //segmented path : different rotating angles 
- //add static nodes -- dont rotate 
- path node relative angle --> if segmented 

Dancer.cs
- //have the dancer move along the path 
- dancer behaviour (change of getures)
- //dancer facing towards the path

PathNetwork.cs
//path node manager 
- //Manage connection logic between the path nodes 
- //Fail + Success state

polish:
Sound Effect:
	dancer move + dancer stop/stuck 
	cylinder spinning sound 
	success sound
