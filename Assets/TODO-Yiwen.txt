// for yiwen 
for the rotating path puzzle 

basic functions 
- node up vwctor <-- customize

PathNode.cs
- //rotate the cylinder 
- //rotate the cylinder to the right position -- //more robust condition test 
- //[DONE] linear path (continued) 
- //linear path (segemented : need to rotate twice)
- //segmented path : different rotating angles 
- //add static nodes -- dont rotate 
- //path node relative angle --> if segmented 

Dancer.cs
- //have the dancer move along the path 
- dancer behaviour (change of getures)
- //dancer facing towards the path
- //start the music control 
- spline walker duration --> speed --> distance between the control points  

PathNetwork.cs
//path node manager 
- //Manage connection logic between the path nodes 
- //Fail + Success state
- start with a certain node: need to update the node active path
- interlock node logic check 


polish:
Sound Effect:
	dancer move + dancer stop/stuck 
	cylinder spinning sound 
	success sound

Modeling 

Temp art:
- //Music box 
- //Dancer 
- Rigging dancer + basic animation
- Dog Cave + little dog shadows 
- TM Temp
- Path particle + trail renderer
- Go-around (rotating + music change)
- The Slider (set up animation) 
- mod the music box 
- 


UI:
- three buttons for the UI
